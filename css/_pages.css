   Page-Specific Styles

   This file contains styles unique to specific pages or large, distinct
   sections of the website. For this template, many layout concerns are
   handled within _layout.css or directly on components.

/* This file can be used for very specific overrides or new sections
   that you might add beyond the template's initial structure.
   For now, it is minimal to match the template's straightforward approach.
