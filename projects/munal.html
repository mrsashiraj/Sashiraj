            <h3>1. Project Background & Business Problem</h3>
            <p>
                MUNAL, a budding **luxury car brand with its base in Nepal**, was looking to deepen its understanding of its high-value customer base and predict future purchasing behaviors. The primary business problem was to identify key customer segments within the Nepalese luxury automotive market and forecast customer lifetime value (CLTV) to optimize marketing spend and personalize outreach strategies. This was crucial for a brand looking to establish a strong, loyal customer presence in a competitive niche market.
            </p>

        <section class="project-section section-container">
            <h3>2. Approach & Tools Used</h3>
            <p>My approach involved a comprehensive data science pipeline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:</strong> Gathered customer transaction data, demographics, vehicle maintenance history, and interaction logs from MUNAL's CRM and sales databases using SQL. Performed extensive data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering in Python (Pandas) to prepare the dataset for modeling.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to visualize customer purchasing patterns, popular models, service frequency, and geographic distribution. This helped identify initial trends and potential segmentation variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Applied unsupervised machine learning techniques (K-Means clustering with Scikit-learn) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, brand engagement, and vehicle preferences. Identified distinct segments such as "Early Adopters & Innovators," "Loyal Enthusiasts," and "Value-Conscious Buyers."</li>
                <li><strong>Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction:</strong> Developed a predictive model using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor with Scikit-learn) to forecast the future revenue a customer is expected to generate over their relationship with MUNAL. Key features included past purchase frequency, average purchase value, and recency of last purchase.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Evaluation & Validation:</strong> Evaluated model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared, ensuring robustness and accuracy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL (MySQL).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>**Targeted Marketing:** The identified customer segments allowed MUNAL's marketing team to tailor campaigns more effectively. For instance, "Early Adopters" received previews of new models, while "Loyal Enthusiasts" were offered exclusive service packages.</li>
                <li>**Optimized CLTV:** By predicting CLTV, MUNAL could focus retention efforts on high-value customers and adjust acquisition strategies to target profiles with high predicted CLTV.</li>
                <li>**Personalized Outreach:** Sales teams were equipped with insights into each customer's segment, enabling more personalized communication and product recommendations.</li>
                <li>**Resource Allocation:** The analysis informed more efficient allocation of resources, reducing marketing spend on less profitable segments and increasing investment in high-potential customer groups.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, this project provided MUNAL with a data-driven framework to understand and engage their luxury customer base, fostering brand loyalty and supporting strategic growth in the Nepalese market.</p>
